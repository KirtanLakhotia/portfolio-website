    <h2 class="researchTitle">1) Twitter sentiment analysis using ensemble of multi-channel model based on machine learning and deep learning techniques</h2>

        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
    <p class="researchText">
        People post a lot of comments on the websites these days, as social media and the Internet are major parts of modern life. With so much information available online related to services, products, politics, stocks, etc., thus, using artificial intelligence to understand the emotions in these comments is highly beneficial for understanding public opinion. In particular, detecting sentiment polarity in customer reviews is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions. Despite the vast amount of information available on the internet, understanding the underlying emotions in user comments remains a challenge. Our work aims to bridge this gap by proposing a sophisticated sentiment analysis model that leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In this study, we present a sentiment analysis model that combines advanced deep learning neural networks: convolutional neural network, long short-term memory networks (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Accurate feature extraction plays a pivotal role in sentiment analysis applications. By merging pre-trained BERT with sophisticated neural networks, the devised model achieves an impressive accuracy of 94.95%. We evaluated the proposed model on a publicly available Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset. The proposed ensemble multi-channel model outperforms several deep learning and machine learning techniques in sentiment analysis. Hence, we suggest the use of the ensemble model to accurately determine sentiments from tweets and other textual data.

    <h2 class="researchTitle">2) COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Classification Using Hybrid Deep Learning Model Based on Grid Search Methodology</h2>
      <div class="container rearchContainer">
        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
    <p class="researchText">
    In the contemporary era, social media platforms amass an extensive volume of social data contributed by their users. In order to promptly grasp the opinions and emotional inclinations of individuals regarding a product or event, it becomes imperative to perform sentiment analysis on the user-generated content. Microblog comments often encompass both lengthy and concise text entries, presenting a complex scenario. This complexity is particularly pronounced in extensive textual content due to its rich content and intricate word interrelations compared to shorter text entries. Sentiment analysis of public opinion shared on social networking websites such as Facebook or Twitter has evolved and found diverse applications. However, several challenges remain to be tackled in this field. The hybrid methodologies have emerged as promising models for mitigating sentiment analysis errors, particularly when dealing with progressively intricate training data. In this article, to investigate the hesitancy of COVID-19 vaccination, we propose eight different hybrid deep learning models for sentiment classification with an aim of improving overall accuracy of the model. The sentiment prediction is achieved using embedding, deep learning model and grid search algorithm on Twitter COVID-19 dataset. According to the study, public sentiment towards COVID-19 immunization appears to be improving with time, as evidenced by the gradual decline in vaccine reluctance. Through extensive evaluation, proposed model reported an increased accuracy of 98.86%, outperforming other models. Specifically, the combination of BERT, CNN and GS yield the highest accuracy, while the combination of GloVe, BiLSTM, CNN and GS follows closely behind with an accuracy of 98.17%. In addition, increase in accuracy in the range of 2.11% to 14.46% is reported by the proposed model in comparisons with existing works.    </p>
